# sql-challenge

The employee sql challenge had several different parts accociated with it. First was the 6 tables that needed to be loaded into our postgres file so that 
we were able to extract and organize all of the data appropriatly. After all that was completed we were then tasked with creating the different tables linking
different columns with diffenet tables by way of keys and foreign keys. 

Once that was completed the different tables were created, each with a different goal to analyize the different employee data that was given.
Below are the table assignments:

  List the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
  
  List the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
 
  List the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
  
  List the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  
  List first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
  
  List each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
 
  List each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
  
  List the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).
  
Also included is an ERG png file that breaks down how all of the tables are related. The relationships are formed with the different
keys and foreign keys associated with each individual table.
